# Recipe App

The Recipe app keeps track of all your recipes, ingredients, and inventory. It will allow you to save ingredients, keep track of what you have, create recipes, and generate a shopping list based on what you have and what you are missing from a recipe. Also, since sharing recipes is an important part of cooking the app should allow you to make them public so anyone can access them.

## Built With

- Visual Studio Code and GitHub.
- Ruby on Rails.
- Linters for RoR.
- Gitflow.

## Getting Started

- In this project, you will use migration files to build your schema.
- Set up models. To start with, we have tables for Users, Posts, Comments, and Likes, which means we need a model for each one. You've already set the foreign key in the table schema but be sure to write it here too!
- In this project, you will add validations to your models and create specs for them.
